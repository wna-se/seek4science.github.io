The SEEK software is developed by teams at the **University of Manchester** in the United Kingdom, **Heidelberg Institute for Theoretical Studies** in Germany, and the **University of Leiden, Netherlands**.

SEEK is funded as part of the Research Infrastructure project [FAIRDOM](https://fair-dom.org), who's current and former members are described [HERE](https://fair-dom.org/about-fairdom/people/)

Of course we are also highly grateful to the input and feedback provided by all our users, 
in particular our [PALS](https://fair-dom.org/communities/pals/pals-gallery/) and [Contributors](https://github.com/seek4science/seek/graphs/contributors).
