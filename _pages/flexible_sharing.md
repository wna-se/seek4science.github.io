There is a lot of flexibility and control over who can see, download or edit your items.

Data files, models, SOPs and also ISA description of your investigations and experimental practices can be kept entirely private, shared with your whole project (or selected members of your project), or the whole set of registered users.

If you are working together with other people, you can give additional users full edit or manage rights.
When you are ready, especially if you are publishing, you can make your items entirely public, accessible to anonymous users without an account. The links to the item never change, so you can point to the data that supports your publications.
