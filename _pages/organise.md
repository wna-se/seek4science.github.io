FAIRDOM-SEEK has adopted an ISATAB style structure for organising experiments and data.

The ISA format (Investigations, Studies and Assays) is a community standardisation activity to allow the association of multiple 'Omics datasets, in the context of the experiments that created them, in order to make it easier to compare and combine different data sets. It also provides the possibility of exporting or importing data from other sources in ISA-TAB format and therefore allows data exchange with a wider community.
